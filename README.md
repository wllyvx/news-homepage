### What I learned

In my first Next.js project, I learned how to build server-rendered React applications using a framework that abstracted away many of the complexities of setting up a server and routing. I became familiar with concepts such as app dir, which are the building blocks of a Next.js application, and learned how to create dynamic routes based on the data I passed to them. Additionally, I learned how to utilize the built-in development server and hot reloading to make my development faster and more efficient. Overall, Next.js allowed me to create high-performance web applications with minimal configuration while still having the full power of React and webpack at my disposal.
